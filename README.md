# Objectives
- To be familiarize with Frequency modulation
- To understand the principles of FM
- To create a Frequency Modulator

# Introduction
A Frequency modulation is a  technique that transmits information into a varying frequency according to its amplitude and its signal. one of the advantage of using Frequency modulation is the ability to transmit message without picking up much any electrical noise to the medium, which is one of the disadvantage of AM and oher types of Amplitude modulation such as DSBSC, SSBSC because it is a varying amplitude signal, which is more susceptive from picking up electrical noise to the medium.
