### Objectives
- To familiarize with Frequency modulation
- To understand the principles of FM
- To create a Frequency Modulator

### Introduction
A Frequency modulation is a  technique that transmits information into a varying frequency according to its amplitude and its signal. one of the advantage of using Frequency modulation is the ability to transmit message without picking up much any electrical noise to the medium, which is one of the disadvantage of AM and oher types of Amplitude modulation such as DSBSC, SSBSC because it is a varying amplitude signal, which is more susceptive from picking up electrical noise to medium, Frequency modulation also provides high quality sound when transmitting the information. However, the disadvantage of using Frequency modulation is that its transmission is complex compared to AM, and it's also expensive. An FM detector usually needs an antenna, specifically a dipole antenna, to receive the transmitted signal while AM doesn't need to; this is because FM has a high-frequency component compared to AM, which creates a shorter wavelength, making the  signal propagation performance poor.

### Block diagram

based on the block diagram it shows that the message is a 2kHz digital masters signals, connected to the Voltage controlled Oscillator module input to the Emona which as a 10kHz carrier, the first channel of the oscilloscope will be connected directly to the Information signal, while channel 2 will be connected to the output of the VCO, basically the expected output is that the output frequency from the VCO should be directly proportional to the signal when the signal is at positive peak.


### Setup

### Output

The output of the signal shows that the carrier frequency increases when the digital message is at a higher voltage, and decreases when the digital message is low, which means it's frequency is directly proportional to the information signal, which is basically how VCO works, forming a Frequency modulation signal that is compatible to the medium.
