# Objectives
- To familiarize with Frequency modulation
- To understand the principles of FM
- To create a Frequency Modulator

**Introduction**

A Frequency modulation is a  technique that transmits information into a varying frequency according to its amplitude and its signal. one of the advantage of using Frequency modulation is the ability to transmit message without picking up much any electrical noise to the medium, which is one of the disadvantage of AM and oher types of Amplitude modulation such as DSBSC, SSBSC because it is a varying amplitude signal, which is more susceptive from picking up electrical noise to medium, Frequency modulation also provides high quality sound when transmitting the information. However, the disadvantage of using Frequency modulation is that its transmission is complex compared to AM, and it's also expensive. An FM detector usually needs an antenna, specifically a dipole antenna, to receive the transmitted signal while AM doesn't need to; this is because FM has a high-frequency component compared to AM, which creates a shorter wavelength, making the  signal propagation performance poor.
